## Support the Project

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M4FX3WA)

Though this is a community project, I still pay for the site to be hosted.
Because of the real-time communication, extra juice is required to reliably
run the service. I pay for all of this out of pocket. Because the service will
always remain free, I rely on donations to keep the service alive. Any donations
are greatly appreciated!

## Project Structure

* **api/**: The REST API responsible for handling interactions with the
database, user authentication, and abstracting web socket brokerage from the
client. This is a simple express application.
* **web/**: The front end part of the application. This runs with React using
Nextjs.
* **ws/**: This is where WebSockets are created and managed.

## Development

### Node.js & Yarn

Firstly, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This is needed
to install the packages for the services, all of which run with Node.js. Once
you've installed Node.js, enable [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

### Docker

Secondly, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This makes it very easy to
locally run the entire stack for local development and testing. Once you've
installed Docker, run the following from the command line:

``` bash
$ docker compose up
```

This should start every part of the stack as well as a couple of utility
services. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and
make sure that the landing page loads up.

### Frontend Pages

* Frontend - `http://localhost:3000`
* PostgresSQL Admin Panel - `http://localhost:8910`
* Mailhog - `http://localhost:8025`
